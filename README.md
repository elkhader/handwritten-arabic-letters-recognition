# Handwritten Arabic letters recognition
### Overview
Machine Learning Python application to recognize Arabic letters using the **classifier k-NN** and the **descriptor LBP**. 


### Dataset
The model was trained on the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1"> Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset</a>. It contains 16800 images of 32x32, each of a signle handwritten arabic letter. 

### k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)
A supervised classification learning algorithm. It assigns the closest neighboring class to an input. 

### Local Binary Pattern (LBP)
A visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision. It's mainly used for texture classification. We noticed, upon applying it on the handwritten pictures, an improvement in the accuracy of the k-NN model.


### Short demonstration

*This application was a part of a school assignment where k-NN and LBP were specifically required. Hence the reason why they were used for this application.*
